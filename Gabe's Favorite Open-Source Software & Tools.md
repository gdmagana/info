Hi all! I want to maintain a list of some of my favorite software to use and the best ways to maximize your productivity. As a macOS user, much of this list will be made with macs (especially newer ones with M1+ chips) in mind, but many of the options here also work on Windows/Linux!

# The best websites on the internet:

# Gaming
Gaming is actually huge on Mac, despite Apple's best efforts! Many tools exist to run Windows games, Console games, and more!

(paid) CrossOver by CodeWeavers is an app that can create emulated Windows environments. Buying it supports the development of Wine, which is the translation layer that makes running these apps on macOS possible. For a free, open source alternative, check out Whisky.

To run certain Epic Games apps, like Rocket League, you can use Heroic Launcher which is an open source UI for the Legendary command line tool. Fortnite is allegedly playable using https://github.com/isacucho/FnMacAssistant, but I personally do not trust Sideloadly since it raises google/apple's malware warnings.

## Emulators:

**DOLPHIN EMULATOR:** https://dolphin-emu.org/ ( wii and gamecube games )
- https://cemu.info/ Wii U emulator
Ryujinx and Yuzu are Switch emulators, but they are oftentimes pulled from Github. Many forks exist, and I recommend Ryujinx for macOS.

- **Play! PS2 Emulator** – Open-source PlayStation 2 emulator (still in development but improving):  
    [https://purei.org/](https://purei.org/)

## Mods:
**[WHEELWIZARD](https://github.com/TeamWheelWizard/WheelWizard)**: (play mario kart wii with the Retro Rewind mod!)
	(shameless plug, i am the dev for this app and i helped port it to macOS)
[Retro Rewind](https://www.retrorewind.info/) is a custom set of tracks for Mario Kart Wii that includes 176 retro tracks from other games and 80 custom tracks made by the community! It's quite fun and has a very active online playerbase across the world.

A similar mod exists for Kirby's Air Ride on the gamecube, but is limited to Windows as far as I know. *Update: apparently you can run it on Mac but it requires a modified dolphin and other workarounds that i have not bothered trying yet*

## Art software:

It's like classic photoshop, but without adobe prices, spyware, TOS, etc. Great when combined with using something like chatGPT for instructions, should the interface and/or tools be unfamiliar
